## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
@dlt.table(
    name="random_trip_data_raw",
    comment="The raw taxi trip data ingested from a landing zone.",
    table_properties={
        "quality": "bronze"
    }
)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data engineers looking to streamline data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration tasks. Data analysts responsible for managing and processing lakehouse data for analysis, reporting, and visualization will also find this book beneficial. Additionally, DataOps/DevOps engineers will find this book helpful for automating the testing and deployment of data pipelines, optimizing table tasks, and tracking data lineage within the lakehouse. Beginner-level knowledge of Apache Spark and Python is needed to make the most out of this book.

## To get the most out of this book
While not a mandatory requirement, to get the most out of this book, it’s recommended that you have
