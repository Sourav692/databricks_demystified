    "\n",
    "Change Data Capture (CDC) is the process that captures the changes in records made to transactional Database (Mysql, Postgre) or Data Warehouse. CDC captures operations like data deletion, append and updating, typically as a stream to re-materialize the table in external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "CDC enables incremental loading while eliminating the need for bulk load updating.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Things get especially complex to implement if you have out of order events. If you need to sequence your changes by a timestamp and receive a modification which happened in the past, then you not only need to append a new entry in your SCD table, but also update the previous entries.  \n",

    "Delta Live Table makes all this logic super simple and let you create a separate table containing all the modifications, from the begining of the time. This table can then be used at scale, with specific partitions / zorder columns if required. Out of order fields will be handled out of the box based on the _sequence_by \n",
